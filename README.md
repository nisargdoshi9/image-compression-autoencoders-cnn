# Image Compression using AutoEncoders

An autoencoder neural network is a convolutional neural nerwork that uses backpropagation to set the target values to the inputs.
Autoencoders are used to compress our inputs into a more compact representation. If the original data is required, it can be reconstructed from the compressed data.
In this project, CNN based autoencoders are used for image compression.
